                Badrinath Dham, one of the most revered pilgrimage sites in
                India, is located in the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand.
                Nestled in the majestic Himalayas, this sacred town is dedicated
                to Lord Vishnu, particularly in his form as Badrinarayan.
                Badrinath is part of the esteemed Char Dham Yatra, attracting
                millions of devotees each year who seek spiritual solace and
                divine blessings. The pristine environment, rich mythology, and
                ancient temples make Badrinath a must-visit destination for

                According to Hindu mythology, Badrinath is believed to be the
                place where Lord Vishnu meditated for centuries in the form of a
                badri (berry) tree to escape the wrath of Goddess Lakshmi.
                Enraged by Lord Vishnu’s prolonged meditation, she transformed
                into a stone and appeared in the temple. It is said that after
                Lord Vishnu resumed his divine duties, Goddess Lakshmi returned
                to her original form. This legend adds immense spiritual
                significance to Badrinath, making it a sacred destination for
                devotees seeking the blessings of Lord Vishnu and Goddess
                Lakshmi.
